# Overview

Jupyter Notebook and R script solution for the employee salary data processing assignment using the provided `employee data.xlsx`.

# Files

- `employee_salary.ipynb` --- main notebook
- `employee data.xlsx`   --- input data (provided)
- `Employee Profile.zip`  --- zipped employee profiles (generated)
- `unzip_and_view_profiles.R` ---- R script to unzip & display
- `README.md`  --- this file

# Instructions for Using the Code

# Python (Jupyter Notebook)

1. Ensure `employee data.xlsx` is in the same directory as the notebook.
2. Install required libraries if needed: `pip install pandas openpyxl` (for MsExcel).
3. Open `employee_salary.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook or VS Code.
4. Run all cells sequentially from top to bottom.
   - It will load the data, create the dictionary, test the function, export sample employee CSVs, and create the zip file.
5. Outputs:
   - Printed messages and data previews.
   - Generated files: `Employee Profile` folder, `Employee Profile.zip`, and `unzip_and_view_profiles.R`.
6. Customize:
   - Change `employees_to_export` list in cell 5 to export different employees.
   - The function handles names case-insensitively and suggests similar names on error.

# R 

1. Ensure `Employee Profile.zip` is in the working directory.
2. Install R if not already ( use Rstduio).
3. Run the script:
   - In terminal: `Rscript unzip_and_view_profiles.R`
   - Or open in RStudio, set working directory, and source the file.
4. Output:
   - Unzips to `Employee_Profile_Unzipped`.
   - Prints contents of each CSV file.
